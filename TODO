TODO:

* conditional method bypass (condition is optional),
* generic event handling in builder (rather than specific adder methods),
* refactor Decorator class to remove private methods blocking colliding method names,
* introduce TrueType and FalseType for loose boolean checks,
* implement events for other calls, __callStatic(), __invoke() and so on.
